    "1. **Nominal**: These variables represent categories without any particular order. For example:\n",

    "   - **Color** (Red, Blue, Green)\n",
    "\n",
    "   There is no inherent order to these categories, and the numbers or labels are used to group similar data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ordinal**: These variables represent categories with a clear, ordered relationship between them. For example:\n",
    "   - **Education Level** (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, Ph.D.)\n",
    "   - **Rating** (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)\n",
    "   - **Rank** (1st, 2nd, 3rd)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, the categories have an inherent ranking or order, but the difference between the categories is not necessarily uniform or measurable.\n",

    "### Quantitative Variables\n",
    "Quantitative variables (also called **numerical variables**) represent measurable quantities and can be expressed with numbers. They can be divided into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discrete**: These variables can only take specific, distinct values and are typically counted. For example:\n",
    "   - **Number of children in a family**\n",
    "   - **Number of cars owned**\n",
    "   - **Number of students in a classroom**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Continuous**: These variables can take any value within a given range and are typically measured. For example:\n",
    "   - **Height**\n",
    "   - **Weight**\n",
    "   - **Temperature**\n",
    "   - **Time**\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous variables can take infinitely many values between any two numbers (e.g., 1.5, 2.5, 3.7, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Quantitative Variables:\n",
    "- Height (in cm or inches)\n",
    "- Age (in years)\n",
    "- Income (in dollars)\n",
    "- Weight (in kilograms)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "1. **Categorical Variables**:\n",
    "   - **Nature**: Represent categories or labels.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Gender, Color, Product Type.\n",
    "   - **Operations**: You can calculate mode (most frequent category) and use them for grouping or comparison but not for mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quantitative Variables**:\n",
    "   - **Nature**: Represent numeric values that can be measured or counted.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Age, Salary, Distance.\n",
    "   - **Operations**: You can perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conversion of Categorical to Quantitative:\n",
    "Categorical variables are often converted into numeric format for machine learning models. For instance, you might convert \"Male\" and \"Female\" into `0` and `1` (binary encoding), or use techniques like **one-hot encoding** for variables with more than two categories.\n",

    " Using One-Hot Encoding (for variables with more than 2 categories)\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding creates a new binary column for each category. For example, for a column with three categories, the column will be split into three binary columns, each indicating whether a category is present for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "pd.get_dummies(): This function automatically converts a categorical column into multiple binary columns. Each column represents a category, where 1 indicates the presence of that category (True) and 0 indicates its absence (False) - also known as one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "columns=['species']: Tells pandas which column(s) you want to apply one-hot encoding to — in this case, the 'species' column.\n",
    "\n",
    "prefix=['species']: This adds a prefix to the names of the new dummy columns to make them more readable or avoid confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "Label Encoding: Converts each category into a unique integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding: Converts each category into a separate binary (0 or 1) column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Label Encoding when the categorical variable has an inherent order or is binary. Use One-Hot Encoding for nominal categories with no inherent order (such as Species in the Iris dataset).\n",
